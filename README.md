This lab report focuses on the superconducting behavior of the cuprate superconductor (Bi-2223- Bi1.8Pb0.26Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x) and the hysteresis curve formed due to the magnetic field applied on it and against the magnetic field that is developed inside of it at 77K temperature. 
A hall probe inside a current carrying coil was used to take the measurements. 
Multiple calibration measurements were done before the hysteresis was plotted the celebrative measurements included, the ratio of magnetic field induced inside at the coil center with a 0.5Amp current at room temperature (0.03 +/âˆ’ 0.03 T/A), the ratio of hall potential and coil current at room temperature (3.51+/- 0.06 V/A) and the ratio of hall potential and coil potential at 77 K (0.212+/- 0.003). 
For the superconductor part of the experiment a tube shell of the superconductor was insert on top of the hall probe, while the setup was at 77 K and the data was measured that included the range of hall potential and the coil potential. 
The data measured was then analyzed using the calibration values resulting in a range of intrinsic and applied magnetic field values which were then plotted to provide a hysteresis curve from which the values of trapped 
(9 +/-2 mT) and shielded magnetic field (9 +/- 1 mT) was extracted. 
These values should be equal theoretically, an average (9 +/- 1 mT) of the values was then used to calculate the critical current density (1,721,627 +/- 190,000 A/m2). 
There were some sources of error that were difficult to account for numerically such as the hall probe was changed during the experiment and was exposed to extremely low temperatures for a long time. 
A long-time exposure to 77 K temperature leads to issues in the hall probes readings.

The repository contains an Excel file with datda and its analysis along with MATLAB code for analysis purposes. The lab report elaborates on the whole experiment conducted along with the results and findings.
